# Changelog — GA4 Attribution Models

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Source/medium extraction now uses GA4-UI-style first-non-auto-event rule** across all 15 SQL files. Replaces the previous `session_start`-only approach. Logic: the first non-`session_start`/`first_visit` event with source/medium in `event_params` becomes the session's traffic source; falls back to `session_start` params if no primary exists. This aligns with how the GA4 UI attributes session source/medium and reduces drift vs. the UI from 5–15% on production data. Fixes #7.
- **Time-decay constant changed** from `0.1/hour` (≈7-hour half-life, degenerated to last-click in practice) to `0.00412/hour` (≈7-day half-life, matching GA4's default). Affects `time-decay-model-attribution.sql`, `cross-channel-comparison.sql`, `attribution-mart.sql`, `attribution_dashboard.sql`. Fixes #3.
- **BQML probability extraction fixed** in `data_driven_attribution.sql`: `predicted_converted_probs[OFFSET(0)].prob` may return P(not converted) because BQML array order is not guaranteed. Replaced 5 occurrences with `(SELECT prob FROM UNNEST(predicted_converted_probs) WHERE label = 1)`. Fixes #1.
- **Data-driven model extended to 8-channel taxonomy** (was 4 channels: organic, cpc, social, email). Now includes display, referral, affiliate, and direct, matching the rule-based models' channel grouping. Fixes #5.
- **Linear attribution semantics aligned** between `attribution-mart.sql` and `linear-model-attribution.sql`. The mart's m4 CTE previously used `SELECT DISTINCT` (per-distinct-channel credit), while the standalone model used per-session credit. The mart now uses per-session credit. Fixes #4.
- **Path analysis and paths dashboard** now use the same `sessions` CTE as the attribution models. Path lengths and channel sequences now reconcile across the dashboard. Fixes #6.

### Documentation
- **Relabeled "Shapley-style" to "feature-ablation attribution"** in README, code comments, and `data_driven_attribution.sql`. The existing implementation does single-pass feature ablation (remove one feature at a time), not true Shapley values (which require evaluating all 2^N subsets). Fixes #2.
- Added this CHANGELOG.md.
- Added note about 30-day lookback truncation by `_TABLE_SUFFIX` filter in `data-preparation/google-analytics-4-data-preparation.sql`. Fixes #8.
- Added 8-channel taxonomy documentation and extension guidance for custom channels in `data_driven_attribution.sql`. Fixes #5.
- Updated `utils/setup_views.sql` to document the first-non-auto-event rule as the canonical approach for public dataset users.

### Fixed
- `validation-queries.sql` now uses the canonical sessions CTE for all validation checks, ensuring consistency with the models.

### Notes
- Files intentionally NOT modified: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/test-sql.yml`, `dashboard/funnel_dashboard.sql`, `ecommerce_funnel/*.sql`, `dashboard/README.md`.
